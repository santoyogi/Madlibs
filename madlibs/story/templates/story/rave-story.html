            {{ item.name }} wanted to party. They wanted to dance,
            {{ item.action1 }}, shake and mingle. {{ item.name }}
            ordered an uber and made their way to the
            {{ item.adjective1 }} monkey, a local club. Inside,
            the music was bumping, the people were mixing and the
            air was full of energy. {{ item.name }} was there for
            one thing and one thing only. They wanted to
            {{ item.action2 }}. And {{ item.action2 }} they did.
            They {{ item.action2 }}ed so hard that their
            {{ item.object }} flew off and they began to sweat.
            They perspired so hard that there was a puddle forming
            around them. Everyone noticed and gave them a
            {{ item.negativeVerb }} look. However, they were no match
            for this {{ item.adjective2 }} animal. Eventually, the
            whole club filled with sweat and {{ item.liquid }}.
            Soon everyone drowned and diedâ€”the end.
