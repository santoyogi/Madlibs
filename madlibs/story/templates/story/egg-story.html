            There once was a very {{ item.adjective }} egg. His name was
            {{ item.maleName }} and they were so {{ item.adjective }} that
            they never had a girlfriend. However, {{ item.maleName }} was
            determined to change that. So he went on eggHarmony.com and there
            he found a beautiful {{ item.eggItem }}. Her name was Eggberta and
            she was just what {{ item.maleName }} was looking for. Their date
            would be that following Saturday so {{ item.maleName }} had plenty
            of time to prepare. The first thing they did was paint their shell
            {{ item.color }}. Then they cut their hair to get a {{ item.hairstyle }}
            and now they were ready to go. That Saturday {{ item.maleName }} and
            Eggberta met up at {{ item.place }}. There, they ate {{ item.food }}
            and hit it off really well. At the end of the date, {{ item.maleName }}
            asked Eggberta if she would marry him, and she said
            {{ item.yesOrNo }}â€”the end!
