            They say {{ item.fruit }} is part of a balanced breakfast. So, Sam had
            {{ item.fruit }} every day, and he also had {{ item.food }} with it.
            As well as a {{ item.liquid }} to wash it down, but it didnâ€™t stop
            there. He also enjoyed some good ole {{ item.object }} on the side.
            Some {{ item.noun }} to sprinkle on top. And of course a good ole
            {{ item.animal }} to finish it off. After his breakfast, he felt
            {{ item.adjective1 }} so he would go for a daily
            {{ item.actionVerb }}. Sam has a {{ item.adjective2 }} morning routine!
