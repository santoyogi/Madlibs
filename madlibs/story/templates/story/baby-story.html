            The {{ item.LastName }} couple were expecting a new baby very soon.
            They hoped it would have {{ item.color1 }} colored eyes and
            {{ item.color2 }} hair. The day the baby arrived was very
            {{ item.adjective1 }}. The baby looked nothing as expected. First
            of all, it wasnâ€™t a baby at all! It was actually a {{ item.animal }}.
            with {{ item.color3 }} beady eyes, a {{ item.adjective2 }} nose and
            huge teeth. The couple were shocked and wondered if they should
            {{ item.verb }} it. But this was their beloved baby, and they decided
            against it. Surprisingly they raised the baby happily, and it grew up
            to be a very successful {{ item.jobTitle }}!
